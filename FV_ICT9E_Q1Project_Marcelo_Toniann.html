			<p style="display: inline-grid;"> The book of 'Noli Me Tangere' mainly focuses on the potrayal of Filipino's brainwashed state in the first 20 kabanatas or chapters. With it's many interesting characters and unique integratation of issues still relevant today, it is a book that is required to be taught in the Philippine's education system. </p>
			<p title="Well, except for maybe Kapitan Tiago...">As for this blog, I specifically chose these characters as I find them the most interesting and underrated characters in Noli Me Tangere (hover over me!)</p>
			<p> I wish to convey the brilliance of these characters in the story that one of Philippine's greatest national heroes. </p>
			<p>I suggest you fullscreen the browser you're using with the zoom on 90% to see get the intended look and feel of the website. Without further ado, let us proceed onto the first of the four... <br><br><b><a href="#K" style="font-size: 35px; color: navajowhite;"> Kapitan Tiago. </a></b></p>

			<p title="from a poor family. Scaramouche, Scaramouche, will you do the Fandango?">Kapitan Tiago was once a poor boy.</p>
			<p> He was once an <i>utusan</i> or otherwise known as a servant.</p>
			<p> He then worked for a nice priest who let him study in a good school. He, of course, graduated and became the "successful" <br> man he is now. </p>
			<p> However, to stay in his place of power, he needed to gain the favour of the higher ups and to do this, he did everything <br> he can to become the perfect <b style="font-family: monospace;"> bootlicker. </b> Forgetting his origins as a Filipino in order to blend in with the <i> Kastila </i> <br> (Spaniards) in power, oppressing his fellow Filipinos as he looks down on them with despise. To seal the deal, one day when Padre Damaso was angry at him because of Crisostomo's doubts in the government, he turned off the candle Maria Clara and himself lit for Ibarra's safe travels.</p>
			<p> Due to his own trauma, he shut out the part of himself that made him <b> Filipino </b> in hopes he would never go back to his origins as a Filipino servant.</p>

				<p>Crispin is the youngest child of a poor Filipino family. </p>
				<p> He was a good kid who knew how to read and worked in the church along with his brother. </p>
				<p> While he was working in the church, two gold pieces went missing and Crispin was held accountable due to his race and was called a <i> Mangnanakaw </i> (Theif). </p>
				<p> The harassment he received got so bad that they took the only income his brother had to feed their family. After a few days <br> of working and being called a theif, a <i> Sakristan </i> came along one night and took him away to a room to pressumably torture him and kill him. All of this happened while the <i> Sakristan </i> didn't even have any sort of evidence that Crispin really did the crime. </p>
				<p> Without hearing him out, he was killed. This became a metaphor for how Filipinos who were <i>silenced</i> because of crimes were treated back then.</p>

			<p> Basilio was your typical eldest child.</p>
			<p> He would take care of the household, help around with chores and even work to earn money for daily necessities at church.</p>
			<p> He and Crispin (the labelled "theif") had been working one night when Crispin started to spout some hypothetical thoughts to him. </p>
			<p> Hearing Crispin say that it would've been better if he had stolen the two golden pieces and died because it would've given him and <br> his mother some spare cash was what finally broke his composure. He stood up telling Crispin not to say such things when the Senior <i>Sakristan</i> walked in. Powerless, he watched as his brother helplessly screamed and begged for someone to save him and stayed until his wails went silent.</p>
			<p> Filipinos who did not speak up for those who were convicted are also afraid of what might happen to them if they did, no matter if it was the right thing to do. This became the norm for those in the lower classes and not only did they lose their <i>identity</i> as a Filipino, they were slowly losing their <i>humanity</i>.</p>

				<p> Pilosopo Tasio is a wise old man. </p>
				<p> He was regarded as either a very straight-forward philosopher (<i>pilosopo</i>) or a crazed fanatic (<i>baliw</i>). </p>
				<p> He has made his stand on how the <i>Kastila</i> (Spaniards) handle the Philippines being one of their colonies. </p>
				<p> In <i>kabanata</i> (chapter) 14, he explicitly called out the church for its religious extortion of the people who regularly attend mass and worship God. He specifically called them out on their use of the concept of purgatory. You see, back in their day, every year they had to pay the equivalent of around Php 200-300 to spare their loved ones from the torment happening in purgatory and usually, people are sentenced to purgatory for around hundreds to thousands of years. Imagine doing this every year on the day of the dead with multiple dead relatives, the payment really starts to rack up. </p>
				<p> For an old man, his thinking was ahead of his time and his skepticism was something that the Filipinos at the time needed to <b><i>wake up.</i></b></p>

				<p style="display: inline-grid;"> ...And that's my take on my favorite characters in 'Noli Me Tangere'! </p>
				<p> As you can tell, these characters really are interesting each in their own ways and the issues they represent that were not only relevant back then, but even 'till today, just in a different form. </p>
				<p> Let us take a moment to appreciate Jose Rizal for creating this book with all its wonderful 3-dimentional characters representing their own issues and for making the characters feel so real to the point where it doesn't feel like you're reading historical <i>fiction</i>. We appreciate his efforts in not only writing this book but opening the eyes of many oppressed Filipinos. </p>
